    "#MOVING AVERAGE CROSSOVER STRATEGY:\n",
    "A moving average crossover strategy is a popular trading strategy that involves the use of two moving averages such as simple or exponential moving averages. In this project, we use two aimple moving averages: Short term moving average(SMA) and Long term moving average(LMA). Buy signal is generated when SMA goes above LMA and sell signal is generated when SMA crosse below LMA."
